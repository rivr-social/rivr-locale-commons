/**
 * Membership CAPABILITIES (2026-07-09).
 *
 * RIVR subscription tiers grant PARALLEL capabilities, not a strict linear
 * hierarchy: Host and Seller are peers — each adds ONE specialty on top of
 * Collaborator, and neither includes the other's. Only Organization has both.
 *
 *   Collaborator (basic)  → claim badges + take jobs in projects
 *   Host                  → Collaborator + create priced event tickets
 *   Seller                → Collaborator + offer paid products/services
 *   Provider              → Host + Seller + Collaborator (tickets AND offerings,
 *                           but NOT organization creation)
 *   Organization (organizer) → all of the above + create organization-type groups
 *   Steward               → ALL capabilities (hidden; tied to a hidden share class)
 *   Worker                → ALL capabilities (hidden; tied to a hidden share class)
 *
 * This replaces ordinal `hasEntitlement(tier)` comparisons for these gates: a
 * Seller must NOT pass the ticket gate, and a Host must NOT pass the offering
 * gate. Community / family / ring groups are free for any signed-in user (no
 * capability required).
